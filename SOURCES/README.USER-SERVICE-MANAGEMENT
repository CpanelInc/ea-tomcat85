Each private tomcat 8.5 instance is setup, via /usr/local/cpanel/scripts/cpuser_service_manager,
so that you can manage it w/ the `ubic` command, the most common commands are:

    `ubic status ea-tomcat85`
    `ubic start ea-tomcat85`
    `ubic stop ea-tomcat85`
    `ubic restart ea-tomcat85`

There are others, `man ubic` for details.

Note: If `ubic` is not in your PATH you will need to add it. For example, if you use BASH you could add this to your .bashrc:

    export PATH=$(dirname $(readlink /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/perl)):$PATH
