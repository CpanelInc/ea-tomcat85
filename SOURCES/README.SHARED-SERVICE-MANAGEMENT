If you want to run an instance of tomcat as the tomcat users based out of /opt/cpanel/ea-tomcat85/ (as opposed to a private instance running as the user based out of ~/ea-tomcat85) you are free to do so at your own risk.

For security (and other) reasons, the only method we recommend and support is the private instance method. (If you want ea3’s proxying bahavior you can achieve that w/ a private instance by using ~/ea-tomcat85/conf/server.xml proxy via Apache’s mod_proxy_ajp. Note: the tomcat user can’t see a user’s homedir so this can’t be used to mimic ea3’s shared tomcat without making your server extremely insecure.)

If you still want to proceed these are the basic steps you’ll need to follow (depending on your needs they may be different).

1. Make sure you understand tomcat 8.5 very well

2. Setup Log Rotation

    Install /opt/cpanel/ea-tomcat85/sample.ea-tomcat85.logrotate to the appropriate place for your server (e.g. /etc/logrotate.d/ea-tomcat85)

3. Setup Service Monitoring

    Install the appropriate service/init file for your system.

    E.g.

        For C7, /opt/cpanel/ea-tomcat85/sample.ea-tomcat85.service would go to /etc/systemd/system/ea_tomcat85.service

        For C6, /opt/cpanel/ea-tomcat85/sample.ea-tomcat85.initd would go to /etc/init.d/ea_tomcat85

4. Secure Your Configuration

5. Fine Tune It
